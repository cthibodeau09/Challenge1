# Challenge1

## Description

- My motivation came from seeing the desired website at the end, but receiving code that didnt 100% work properly. 
- I worked on this site to get rid of bugs in the code so that the website could function, such as the links in the navigation.
- I learned how to break down, fix and rebuild code using semantic elements. I also learned how to organize code in the CSS for better organization and viewing for the next developer.
